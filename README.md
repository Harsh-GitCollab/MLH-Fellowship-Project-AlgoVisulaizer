# MLH-Fellowship-Project-AlgoVisulaizer


This project is my sincere effort to showcase my code skills and hardwork. This is a algorithm visulaisation, projects where I have tried visualising the 4 famous sorting algorithms. Nmmely -
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort

The index.html file is the entry point. The index.hml is connected to script.js and the script folder contains the javascript files for the animation of the four algorithms.

I am using HTML 5 canvas.
